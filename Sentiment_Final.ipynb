The place was specialising in Goan cuisines. \\n\\nAnyway, we ordered Whisky and...starters, paneer was corky and oily. The garlic bread with cheese was good. After few drinks, we ordered the mains. A yellow dal and roti. Dal was very watery.\\n\\nFinally, a long bill, separated for food and drinks, came and at the corner, it was written Rs.5714 and demanded us to pay this. I was sure that my bills would not have reached that level. So, I checked and told him that it was only Rs.3750! \\n\\nAs usual, he felt sorry and told that it was a mistake and Rs. 5714 pertained to another table nearby! Then, we called the Supervisor and asked why the mistake on the bill was always on higher side! He said it was genuine mistake! He was not genuine in his apology. \\n\\nMaybe, he thought, he could get away with me, that too after few drinks! Totally disappointed with this kind of cheap shot from a restaurant, which looked otherwise good. \\n\\nBuyers beware!More</td>\n",
